          <h2>About </h2>
          <br>
          <p>I am a determined and hungry to succeed professional, graduated with a <strong>Communication Sciences</strong> degree from The University of Bucharest and currently studying <strong>UX Design</strong> at The Hague University of Applied Sciences.</p>
          <p>Previously worked for Hootsuite (the SaaS leader in enterprise social media management) as a Customer Support Advocate and later on, as an Enterprise Customer Advocate. During that time, I assisted people globally (email, chat, phone) with an all time average satisfaction level of 92% and a Quality Assurance (QA) of 97%.</p>
          <p>I worked with all types of clients and companies - from SMBs, freelancers, agencies to Fortune 500 companies such as Adobe, Allianz, Santander and others. Prior to these roles in support, I did a 2-year series of internships in Europe with the missions to get accustomed to working with multicultural teams and to practice my language skills.</p>
