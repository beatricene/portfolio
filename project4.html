        <h1>Creative Coding | Processing Bootcamp</h1>
        <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
        <p>The drawing above represents the final assignment of an intensive 5-day bootcamp on creative coding with Processing. Processing is a popular software within the visual arts and it uses the Java language. To better understand where it is situated, please have a look at the family tree of coding languages presented in the image below.</p>

        <h2>THE PROCESS</h2>
        <p>For the first assignment of the Programming Bootcamp, I created a drawing of a concept which, every time you run the sketch, is different but still the same. My drawing represents an abstract face - two eyes, one mouth and a nose, all changing their place and colour every time you run the code. Click on the Restart icon in the middle of the menu below to see the result.</p>

        <p>For the second project, I created an interactive image that had to incorporate several dynamic patterns. Inspired by one of the exercises I did in class, I started by creating a set of rectangles that move on a vertical line and whenever you move the mouse over the canvas, that line follows the mouse. I thought it would be interesting to add a horizontal line as well.</p>
        <p>I added to that set of lines another one, but this time, I wanted them to go to the opposite corner of the canvas when I go to the mouse in the upper-right corner. Last, to increase the interactivity, I added the word "Hello!", which can be seen when pressing the Space bar. The colors I chose are black and phosphorescent green, which might make you think of Matrix.</p>

        <p>The third project is a version of Pacman called Pink Pacperson. If you want to try playing it, I would recommend opening it in OpenProcessing. The rules are simple: you need to help Pink Pacperson get to Momma Pacperson without touching any pacperson you meet on the way. </p>

        <p>For the last day of the programming bootcamp, we had a free assignment. That motivated me to use Processing to sketch something, since it seemed useful for future assignments and projects.</p>
        <p>I started from an image with a slice of orange and I tried to recreate that with Processing. I drew the background and multiple ellipses at the bottom of the screen. Over the ellipses, I added a rectangle as a frame, I made it transparent and I added a white stroke, so that is covers the part of the ellipses that gets over the background. Over the ellipses, I drew lines at different parameters, so that it would give the ellipses the image of a slice of orange.</p>
        <p>At the end, I used the drawing as the background for a presentation. I added a font to my code and wrote 4 lines of text that show up on the screen when you press "b/B", "q/Q", "n/N" and "y/Y"</p>
